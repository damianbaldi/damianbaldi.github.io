		<h3>SUMARIO</h3>

		<p>After a long career on telecommunication and telephone systems, I felt it was time for a change. I've recently and amicably parted ways with the company that I last worked at, and I´m currently looking for new opportunities.</p>  

		<p>In the past year this company had opened a training program for DevOps which I was able to sign up for after passing a rigorous exam. With much excitement I've been taking training programs on various tools and software for half a year now and continue to do so.</p> 
			
		<p>My experience on telephone systems includes administration, maintenance and monitoring of Avaya systems, Nice voice recording systems, dialers and the programing of IVR trees on a platform that attends 4 million customers. To perform these tasks, I used my background on Linux systems, networking knowledge, databases and the understanding and debugging of different telephone protocols as ISDN, R2 and SIP. On the time I had been working with this platform the company merged with other two companies, which lead me to provide different solutions to interoperate with Cisco and Genesys’ systems and adopt new collaborative tools during the pandemic.</p>
			
		<p>It's my goal now to become a DevOps engineer using my vast work experience and the technical knowledge that I have and continue to acquire. I'm aware that with change comes challenges but also opportunities, and I’m more than willing to take them.</p>
